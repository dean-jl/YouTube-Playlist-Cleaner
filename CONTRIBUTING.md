## 🛠 Fork-Friendly by Design

## 🧭 Contribution Guidelines

Before submitting a pull request:
-   Ensure your code adheres to the existing coding style (TypeScript/JavaScript).
-   Run any available linting or formatting commands (e.g., `npm run lint`, `npm run format` if defined).
-   Test your changes thoroughly in a browser environment to ensure they work as expected on YouTube playlist pages.
-   Include a brief description of what your change does and why it’s useful.
-   Update documentation in the `docs/` directory and `README.md` as needed.

## 🧪 Testing Philosophy

This project primarily relies on:
-   **Manual verification** to ensure the extension functions correctly on live YouTube playlist pages.
-   **Browser developer tools** for debugging and inspecting behavior.
